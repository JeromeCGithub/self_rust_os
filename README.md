# self_rust_os
A self made simple OS in Rust.

This is an experimental repository to learn how to make an OS in Rust.

This project is based on the blog post series [Writing an OS in Rust](https://os.phil-opp.com/). I recommend you to read it if you want to learn how to make an OS in Rust.

I'm following the blog post of Philipp Oppermann, then trying to enhance the OS with more features that make me learn more about OS development.
